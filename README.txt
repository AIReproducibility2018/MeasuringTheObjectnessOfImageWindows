This is a reimplementation of the method proposed in "Measuring the Objectness of Image Windows" [1]. The Pascal VOC 2007 [2] dataset was used during the reproduction.
It was created with the purpose of reproducing the results reported in that paper.

The 'Code' folder contains the experiment code written to run the experiments from the original article. It depends on the method code from the original experiment, which must be downloaded separately.
See 'Experiment.txt' for details on the method code.

The 'Results' folder contains the results achieved from re-running the experiments.

'Experiment.txt' contains a summary of the data and experiment setup.
